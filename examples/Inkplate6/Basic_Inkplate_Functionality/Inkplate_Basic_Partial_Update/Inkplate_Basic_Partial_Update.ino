/*
   Basic_partial_update example for e-radionica Inkplate 6
   For this example you will need only USB cable and Inkplate 6
   Select "Inkplate 6(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 6(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   In this example we will show  how to use partial update functionality of Inkplate 6 e-paper display.
   It will scroll text that is saved in char array
   NOTE: Partial update is only available on 1 Bit mode (BW) and it is not recommended to use it on first refresh after
   power up. It is recommended to do a full refresh every 5-10 partial refresh to maintain good picture quality.
