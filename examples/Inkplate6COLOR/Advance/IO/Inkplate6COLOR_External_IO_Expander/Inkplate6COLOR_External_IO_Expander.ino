   Inkplate6COLOR_External_IO_Expander example for Soldered Inkplate 6COLOR
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate 6COLOR, 330 Ohm resistor and LED diode.
   Select "Soldered Inkplate 6COLOR" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Soldered Inkplate 6COLOR" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   Connect resistor to P1-7 pin on IO Expander 2 header at right on the backside (component side) of Inkplate. You will
   have to connect one side of 330 Ohm resistor to P1-7, then other side to anode of LED and finally, cathode pin
   of LED to GND.
