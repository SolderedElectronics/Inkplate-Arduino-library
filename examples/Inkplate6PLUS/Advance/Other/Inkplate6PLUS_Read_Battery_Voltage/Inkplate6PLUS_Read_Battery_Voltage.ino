   Inkplate6PLUS_Read_Battery_Voltage example for Soldered Inkplate 6Plus
   For this example you will need USB cable, Inkplate 6PLUS and a Lithium battery (3.6V) with two pin JST connector.
   Select "e-radionica Inkplate 6Plus" or "Soldered Inkplate 6Plus" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "e-radionica Inkplate 6Plus" or "Soldered Inkplate 6Plus" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   This example will show you how to read voltage of the battery.
