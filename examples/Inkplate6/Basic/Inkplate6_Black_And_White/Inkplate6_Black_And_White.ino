   Inkplate6_Black_And_White example for Soldered Inkplate 6
   For this example you will need only USB cable and Inkplate 6.
   Select "e-radionica Inkplate6" or "Soldered Inkplate6" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "e-radionica Inkplate6" or "Soldered Inkplate6" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   This example will show you how you can draw some simple graphics using
   Adafruit GFX functions. Yes, Inkplate library is 100% compatible with GFX lib!
