   Inkplate_VariPass_Graphs example for e-radionica Inkplate6
   For this example you will need a micro USB cable, Inkplate6, and an available WiFi connection.
   Select "Inkplate 6(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 6(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   This example will show you how you can use the API on the VariPass website to download and display
   a sensor graph on the e-paper display.

   VariPass is a website which allows you to host various online "variables" which you can write to
   and read from using the VariPass API. This allows you to store sensor logs and later retrieve them
   for graphing, analysis, etc.
   This example uses an already public variable as an example. The graph is fed every minute with data
   from Thorinair's (https://github.com/Thorinair/) geiger counter, so each startup of the Inkplate will
   display updated values.

   To learn more about VariPass and how you can use it for your own projects, please visit: https://varipass.org/
   If you want to easily integrate the read/write functionality in your project, use the official library:

    //  eink   - Should be set to true to generate a BW 1 bit bitmap better suitable for Inkplate.
