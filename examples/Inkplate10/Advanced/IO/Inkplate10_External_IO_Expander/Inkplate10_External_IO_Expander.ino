   Inkplate10_External_IO_Expander example for Soldered Inkplate 10
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate6, 330 Ohm resistor and LED diode.
   Select "e-radionica Inkplate10" or "Soldered Inkplate10" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "e-radionica Inkplate10" or "Soldered Inkplate10" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   Connect resistor to P1-7 pin (GPB7 pin on older Inkplates with MCP23017) on IO Expander 2 header at bottom rihgt side
   on the backside (component side) of Inkplate. You will have to connect one side of 330 Ohm resistor to P1-7 (GPB7),
   then other side to anode of LED and finally, cathode pin of LED to GND.

   This example will show you how you can manipulate with I/Os of external IO Expander.
   On this expander all pins are free to use, nothing is connected by the default.
