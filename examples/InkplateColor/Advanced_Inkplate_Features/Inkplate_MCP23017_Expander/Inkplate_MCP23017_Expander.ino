   Inkplate_MCP23017 example for e-radionica.com Inkplate 6COLOR
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate 6COLOR, 330 Ohm resistor and LED diode.
   Select "Inkplate 6COLOR(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 6COLOR(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   Connect resistor to GPB7 pin on MCP23017 header at bottom right corner on the backside (component side) of Inkplate.
   You will have to connect one side of 330 Ohm resistor to GPB7, than other side to anode of LED and finally, cathode
   pin of LED to GND.

   This example will show you how you can manipulate with I/Os of MCP23017 Expander.
   GPB1 is used for enabling battery reading (if Batt solder bridge is bridged between second and third pad)
   GPB2, GPB3 and GPB4 are used for reading touchpad (if Touchpad solder bridges are bridged between second pad and
   third pad). If every thing is connected ok, after you upload code, LED should blink.
