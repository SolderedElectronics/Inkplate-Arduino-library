   Inkplate4_Simple_Deep_Sleep example for Soldered Inkplate 4
   For this example you will need a USB-C cable and Inkplate 4.
   Select "Soldered Inkplate4" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Soldered Inkplate4" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   This example will show you how you can use low power functionality of Inkplate board.
   In deep sleep, whole board will consume about 25uA from battery.
   Inkplate will wake every 20 seconds change content on screen.

   NOTE: Because we are using deep sleep, everytime the board wakes up, it starts program from begining.
   Also, the whole content from RAM gets erased. You can store data that don't wanna lose in the RTC
   memory by adding RTC_DATA_ATTR before the variable name like the variable "slide" below.
