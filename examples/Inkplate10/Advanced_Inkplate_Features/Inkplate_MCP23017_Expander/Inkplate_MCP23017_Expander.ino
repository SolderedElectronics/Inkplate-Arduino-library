   Inkplate_MCP23017 example for e-radionica.com Inkplate 10
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate6, 330 Ohm resistor and LED diode.
   Select "Inkplate 10(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 10(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   Connect resistor to GPB7 pin on MCP23017 header at bottom right corner on the backside (component side) of Inkplate.
   You will have to connect one side of 330 Ohm resistor to GPB7, than other side to anode of LED and finally, cathode
   pin of LED to GND.

   This example will show you how you can manipulate with I/Os of MCP23017 Expander.
   You can only manipulate with Port B of MCP23017 (GPB1-GPB7). Port A is used for epaper panel and TPS65186 PMIC.
   GPB0 is used for ESP32 GPIO0 so you can't use it either.
   GPB1 is used for enabling battery reading (if Batt solder bridge is bridged between second and third pad)
   GPB2, GPB3 and GPB4 are used for reading touchpad (if Touchpad solder bridges are bridged between second pad and
   third pad). If every thing is connected ok, after you upload code, LED should blink.

   DANGER: DO NOT USE GPA0-GPA7 and GPB0. In code those are pins from 0-8!!! Using those, you might permanently damage
   the screen. You should only use pins from 9-15.
